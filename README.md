# OWASP ZAP
OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) is an open-source security tool used for web application testing. It acts as a "man-in-the-middle proxy" between the browser and the web application to detect vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and more. ZAP is widely used by developers, security professionals, and testers to improve application security.
